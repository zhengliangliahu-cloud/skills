## Repository Overview

This repository currently provides one skill package:

- `research-paper-writing/`
  - `SKILL.md`: core workflow and usage rules
  - `references/`: section-specific writing guides and templates
  - `agents/openai.yaml`: agent metadata

Typical use cases:

- Drafting or rewriting Abstract / Introduction / Method / Experiments / Conclusion
- Improving paragraph flow and section logic
- Checking claim-evidence alignment
- Running pre-submission self-review from a reviewer mindset

## Installation

Assume you are in the repository root.

### 1) Codex

Copy the skill into `$CODEX_HOME/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p "$CODEX_HOME/skills"
cp -R research-paper-writing "$CODEX_HOME/skills/"
```

Usage example:

```text
Use $research-paper-writing to improve my paper's Introduction.
```

### 2) CC (Claude Code)

Use either a global or project-level installation.

Global:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.claude/skills"
cp -R research-paper-writing "$HOME/.claude/skills/"
```

Project-level:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -R research-paper-writing .claude/skills/
```

In prompts, explicitly request this skill, for example: `Please use the research-paper-writing skill`.

### 3) Gemini

Copy this skill into your Gemini skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.gemini/skills"
cp -R research-paper-writing "$HOME/.gemini/skills/"
```

Then ask concrete tasks in Gemini (for example, rewriting an Abstract with claim-evidence checks).

## Credits

Again, this repository is primarily based on Prof. Peng Sida (彭思达)'s open notes, while my work focuses on curation and Skills adaptation.
